# ðŸ§ª HTML Resume Practice Project

This is a **beginner-friendly practice project** where I created a resume-style webpage using only HTML.  
It helped me revise and understand important concepts of HTML5 including:

---

## âœ¨ What I Practiced in This Project

- Basic page structure using `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
- Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<figure>`
- Useful attributes like `alt`, `href`, `title`, `src`, `datetime`, `required`, and `placeholder`
- Form elements: `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`
- Table with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<td>`
- Media elements like `<video>`, `<iframe>`
- Practical usage of links, list, headings, and image

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

I made this to **revise and memorize HTML tags** and get comfortable writing clean and structured HTML code.  
It is **not a portfolio** or real-world project, but a personal hands-on HTML revision file.  
The idea was to bring most HTML elements together in one file, so I can revise them later too.
